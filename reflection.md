Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment? Gracia Bareti, Rachel Tolentino
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend? None
- What are your initial impressions of Java? Everything is so much more complicated than python, and i find it harder to debug because it is so hard to read sometimes.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? I understand why object oriented programming is useful now, but I didn't before. I feel like the chatbot would be clunkier in procedural programming.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Using the internet to search up every single thing helped me, I found that nothing is like how it is in Python.
